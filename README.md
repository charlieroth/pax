# Pax

Pax is for consensus. In the spirit of its name, Pax offers a space where the
collective voice is heard and decisions are made. Create polls, share them
within your defined communities, and achieve harmony in decision-making
through our real-time voting system. Whether you seek the unanimous voice of
a global community or the discreet consensus of private groups, Pax provides
a seamless and secure platform to express and gauge opinions. Harnessing the
power of Elixir and Phoenix, Pax ensures your experience is smooth and
peaceful as its namesake implies, making community decision-making a journey
towards collective agreement.
